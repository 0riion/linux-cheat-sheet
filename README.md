# Linux Cheat Sheet

This is a collection of notes about Linux. It is not a complete guide, perhaps this is a good place to remember some of the most important commands and concepts of Linux, and not an starting point for those who want to learn Linux from scratch.

## Levels and Layers in Linux üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

### ‚úî Hardware: Level 1

The hardware is at the base, include the memory to perform computation. (CPU, RAM, disk, network, etc.)

### ‚úî Kernel: Level 2

It is responsible for managing the hardware and providing an interface for the user to interact with the hardware. (system calls, process management, memory management, device drivers, etc.)

### ‚úî User Process: Level 3

The running programs managed by the kernel. (graphical user interface, servers, shell, etc.)

## Hardware: Main Memory üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The main memory is the place where the data and instructions are stored. An slot in the memory is called a byte. The memory is organized in a way that each byte has a unique address. The address is a number that identifies the byte.

## Kernel üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

- Process: Determine the process allowed to access the memory.
- Memory: Determine the memory allowed to be accessed by the process.
- Driver: The kernel acts as interface between the hardware and the user process.

### ‚úî Process Management

- Starting a process: The kernel creates a new process and allocates memory for it.
- Pausing a process: The kernel suspends the process and saves its state.
- Resuming a process: The kernel restores the process state and resumes it.
- Scheduling: The kernel decides which process to run next.
- Terminating a process: The kernel terminates the process and frees its memory.

Note: Many processes can be running simultaneously but only one process can be running at a time.

### ‚úî Memory Management

- Allocating memory: The kernel allocates memory for a process.
- Freeing memory: The kernel frees memory allocated for a process.
- Swapping: The kernel moves a process from memory to disk and vice versa.

### ‚úî Device Drivers

Allowing the user process to interact with a hardware device.

### ‚úî System Calls

Interaction between the user process and the kernel.

- Fork: Create a new process.
- Exec: Start a new program.
- Wait: Wait for a child process to terminate.
- Exit: Terminate a process.
- Kill: Terminate a process.
- Init: Start the init process.

## User Space üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The space that kernel allocated for the user process.

## Users üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

A users is an entity that can run programs. Each user has a unique user ID (UID) and a unique group ID (GID). The user ID is used to identify the user and the group ID is used to identify the group of users.

Note: The root user has UID 0 and GID 0, and it is the only user that can run programs with root privileges which means that has access as administrator on traditional Unix systems. Operating as root can be dangerous. It can be difficult to identify and correct mistakes because the system will let you do anything

---

## The shell üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The shell is program stored in the `/bin/sh` that run commands, these commands can be other programs or built-in features. The shell is also a programming language that can be used to automate tasks.

## The standard input, output and errorüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

### ‚úî Standard input (stdin)

The standard input is the input that a program receives from the keyboard. It is represented by the file descriptor 0.

### ‚úî Standard output (stdout)

The standard output is the output that a program sends to the shell windows. It is represented by the file descriptor 1.

### ‚úî Standard error (stderr)

The standard error is the output that a program sends to the shell windows when it encounters an error. It is represented by the file descriptor 2.

## Arguments üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Arguments are the parameters that a program receives from the shell. They are separated by spaces.

### ‚úî --help

The `--help` argument is a special argument that is used to display the help of a program.

example:

```bash
$ ls --help
```

## Wildcards üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Expands are used to replace a string with another string.

## Shell Variables üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Shell variables are a way to store information that can be accessed by the shell and programs that the shell runs. They are useful for passing information to scripts and storing configuration information.

### ‚úî Setting Variables

Variables are set using the `=` operator. There is no space between the variable name, the equal sign, and the value. The value can be anything, but there are some rules:

- The first character of the variable name must be a letter or underscore.
- The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- There are no spaces allowed around the `=` operator.
- The value can contain anything.
- Variable names are case sensitive. This means that `MY_MESSAGE` and `my_message` are two different variables.

```bash
$ MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
$ echo $MY_MESSAGE
Hello World
```

### ‚úî Variable Types

There are two types of variables: local and environment variables. Local variables are only available to the current shell and any programs that it runs. Environment variables are available to any program that the user runs.

#### ‚úî Local Variables

Local variables are set by assigning a value to them using the `=` operator. They are used to store information for the current shell and any programs that it runs.

```bash
$ MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
$ echo $MY_MESSAGE
Hello World
```

#### ‚úî Environment Variables

Environment variables are set by assigning a value to them using the `export` command. They are used to store information for any program that the user runs.

```bash
$ export MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
$ echo $MY_MESSAGE
Hello World
```

### ‚úî Unsetting Variables

Variables can be unset by using the `unset` command. This removes the variable from the current shell.

```bash
$ MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
$ echo $MY_MESSAGE
Hello World

$ unset MY_MESSAGE
$ echo $MY_MESSAGE

$
```

### ‚úî Variable Substitution

Variables can be substituted into other strings using the `$` character. This is useful for constructing messages.

```bash
$ MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
$ echo "I said $MY_MESSAGE"
I said Hello World
```

### ‚úî Command Substitution

Commands can be substituted into other strings using the `$()` syntax. This is useful for constructing messages.

```bash
$ echo "I said $(echo Hello World)"
I said Hello World
```

## Path Commands üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The `PATH` variable is a special environment variable that is used to store a list of directories. When a user runs a command, the shell looks for that command in each directory in the `PATH` variable. If the command is found, it is run. If the command is not found, an error is displayed. Restarting the shell will reload the `PATH` variable.

### ‚úî Setting the Path

The `PATH` variable can be set using the `export` command.

```bash
$ export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
```

### ‚úî Adding to the Path

The `PATH` variable can be added to using the `:` operator.

```bash
$ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
```

### ‚úî Prepending to the Path

The `PATH` variable can be prepended to using the `:` operator.

```bash
$ export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### ‚úî Unsetting the Path

The `PATH` variable can be unset using the `unset` command.

```bash
$ unset PATH
```

## Special Characters üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

There are a few special characters that have special meanings to the shell. These characters are used to perform operations like globbing, piping, and redirection.

| Character | Name         | Description                                 | input     | output      |
